pano po format ng report ng cluster head?

Just put the main Contents ng Report and they will just input ( CLICK n INPUT) if possible

Flow of reports:
CG leader --> cluster head --> admin
tama po ba?

Yes

bale meron pong 3 types of users?
1. CG leader
2. Cluster head
3. Admin
Pano din po yung registration ng CG leaders? yung admin po ba yung gagawa ng account nila o yung cluster head?

MINISTRY HEADS  have to validate each Care Group if its really existing
YONG ADMIN / Ministry Heads muna
